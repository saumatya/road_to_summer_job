# Project: Carbon Footprint Tracker for Wear OS Smartwatch

## Overview

I had the privilege of working on an international project with Polar Electro Oy in Kempele, Finland. The project's objective was to develop a smartwatch application for Wear OS, using Android and Java. This application aimed to enable users to track their carbon footprint, fostering environmental awareness and encouraging sustainable living.

## Technical Details

- **Platform**: Wear OS (Android)
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Backend Data Persistence**: Online Database

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project was to empower users to make informed decisions to reduce their carbon footprint. This was achieved through the following key components:

1. **Smartwatch Application**: I developed a user-friendly and intuitive smartwatch application that allowed users to track their daily activities.

2. **Online Database**: The project featured a robust online database that facilitated data persistence and enabled users to access and monitor their carbon emissions.

3. **Carbon Emission Tracking**: Users could input data related to their activities, and the application calculated their carbon emissions, providing valuable insights into their environmental impact.

## Impact

This project was not just a technological endeavor but a meaningful contribution to environmental sustainability. It encouraged individuals to make eco-conscious choices by providing them with real-time data about their carbon footprint. This data-driven approach aimed to motivate users to be more environmentally responsible.
